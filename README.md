# Cudele

Experiments for Cudele, a file system with programmable consistency and
durability. With Cudele, developers can custom-fit their application to the
guarantees they need. Looser or weaker guarantees have less overhead. For the
motivation, design, and implementation of the system, please the [Cudele
paper](paper/paper.pdf) that was recently accepted at [IPDPS
'18](http://www.ipdps.org/ipdps2018/2018_advance_program.html#thursday). The
links in each figure in that paper point to an experiment in this repository.
The experiment follows the [Popper Convention](http://falsifiable.us/), so the
directory has all the dependencies, deploy code, results, and graphing code
needed to reproduce the figures. For information about running these
experiments, see the Mantle blogs on our website at 
[programmability.us](http://programmability.us).
